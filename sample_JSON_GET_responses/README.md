The files in the sub-directories under this directory are example responses from the NIBE Uplink API, with a single (F1145) System defined against the user account.

For example, the file `api.nibeuplink.com/api/v1/systems/nnnnn/categories.json` is the JSON response from calling the API https://api.nibeuplink.com/api/v1/systems/nnnnn/categories (where `nnnnn` must be replaced with a real SystemId number).
